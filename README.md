# Plant Leaf Disease Classifier using ResNet50

This repository contains a deep learning classifier trained on the [Plant Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) consisting of 38 classes of plant leaf diseases. 

## Model 

A pre-trained Resnet-50 model was fine-tuned on the Plant Leaf Disease Dataset.

## Deployment

* The trained classifier has been deployed to the Google Vertex AI Endpoint. 
* The flask frontend is hosted on google cloud run.
* Google cloud storage is also used to store the uploaded images.
